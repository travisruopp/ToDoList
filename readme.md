# ToDo Project 

Once upon a time, there was a busy professional named Sarah. Sarah had so many tasks to juggle every day â€“ from work assignments and meetings to grocery shopping and household chores. With all these responsibilities piling up, she found it increasingly challenging to keep track of everything she needed to do.

One day, Sarah missed an important deadline because she forgot about a crucial task buried deep in her long list of to-dos. That's when she realized she needed a better way to manage her tasks and stay organized.

That's where our ToDo application comes in! It's like having a personal assistant that helps Sarah keep track of all her tasks in one place. With our app, Sarah can easily add new tasks, set priorities, assign due dates, and even categorize them based on different projects or areas of her life.

Whenever Sarah completes a task, she can simply mark it as done, and the app will update her list accordingly. No more forgetting important deadlines or feeling overwhelmed by endless to-do lists!

Our ToDo application simplifies Sarah's life by providing a centralized hub for managing her tasks efficiently. Now, she can focus on what truly matters without worrying about missing deadlines or forgetting important tasks.
